# TO Do List
## Description
Having learnt struts and created a login system in my bootcamp (тиетїа), I decided to to extend this project in to a To Do List for my learning.

## Motivation
I have recently switched to a linux environment (Dual Boot on work laptop) because of work. However, I still use Windows environment. The To Do List that I use are not supported on the platforms and therefore I cannot sync my to do lists from my work laptop to home laptop. As a result I have decided to create a web application which can be accessed from any platform/operating system in order to keep track of my To Do List no matter where I am or what machine I am using.

## Features
Java EE
Struts
MySQL

## How to install and run the project
TBC
